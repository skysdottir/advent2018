# Sadly, not actually a genetic algorithm, there's no fitness function
# okay, because my target value ends with a 1, that's either coming from the 10 of a >10 answer,
# or a 1 from a 0+1. Tested both those cases and my code catches it, which means
# it's just an optimization problem. I bet deque[i] is an o(n) function.
# elf position is relative, which means I can bring in my dll code from good old marbles
