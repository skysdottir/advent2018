While you MAY use this software without restriction, you are recommended not 
to. I wrote this code to remind myself how Python works and uploaded it to 
github to work on it across multiple devices and locations. It is not 
standards-compliant and not good code. This code is actively unfit for any 
purpose, including reference.

This code is abandoned. Bug reports and pull requests will recieve no attention
